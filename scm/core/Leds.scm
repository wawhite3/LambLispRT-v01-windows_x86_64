LED ring service (P123 A2) -- generic, robot-agnostic control of the 12-LED
WS2812 ring (see WS2812.scm, Nleds 12).  It owns ZONES, ILLUMINATION, a dedicated
LED behaviour queue, and a PRIORITY ARBITER that plays transient signals over a
persistent base mode.  It knows nothing about what a signal MEANS -- that
vocabulary lives in the robot layer (llip-signals.scm, P123 B4).

Depends on: WS2812.scm (setColor/setBrightness/navLights, ws2812-info, rgb-colors)
            Behaviors.scm (make-behavior-queue, once, once-for, cycle, seq)

The LED queue (led-bq) lives in WS2812.scm and is ticked by Led.loop in the main loop.

;;; ---- small list helper, MODULE-LOCAL ON PURPOSE -------------------------
;;; RENAMED FROM `append-map` 2026-09-09.  It was defined here under the bare SRFI-1 name, and
;;; this file is a LED-PANEL module that ships in ONE manifest (the 4WD).  So `append-map`
;;; appeared to exist tree-wide -- it greps as defined -- while being ABSENT AT RUNTIME on every
;;; other target, linux included.  A general name owned by a peripheral driver is a promise the
;;; build cannot keep, and [P198] found it while inventorying SRFI-1.
;;;
;;; The prefix is the convention this tree already uses for exactly this case: `sr-append-map` in
;;; rxrs/rxrs_syntax_rules.scm is prefixed because it too is module-local.
;;;
;;; THE REAL `append-map` BELONGS IN ONE SHIPPED LIBRARY, and [P198] proposes it:
;;; scm/rxrs/rxrs_srfi1.scm, loaded from setup.scm and in every manifest.  It is deliberately NOT
;;; created here -- P198 owns that surface (it must also settle SRFI-1 `fold` argument order, which
;;; is NOT `fold-left`'s), and its design says plainly: do NOT leave two `append-map`s.
;;!flatmap: append the results of mapping f over lst.  Local to this module; see above.
(define (leds-append-map f lst) (apply append (map f lst)))

;;; ---- zone config (board calibration) ----------------------------------
;;; Indices follow WS2812.navLights: port 0,11 · forward 2,3 · starboard 5,6 ·
;;; aft 8,9.  Role split: a front arc of ~6 = illumination; the rest = signals.
(define led-illum-zone  '(0 1 2 3 4 5))     ; front arc, white, for the camera   -- CALIBRATE
(define led-signal-zone '(6 7 8 9 10 11))   ; status / error patterns            -- CALIBRATE

;;; ---- the arbiter: a persistent base mode + priority-preempting signals -
;;; A dedicated LED queue (decision 2026-06-19): a motion abort never touches
;;; the lights.  A base mode (idle/running/dock) runs until changed; a transient
;;; signal of >= the current priority aborts the queue, plays, then restores base.
;; led-bq is defined in WS2812.scm (loaded first); this service drives that same queue,
;; so the basic Led.blink* helpers and the arbiter share one LED queue (one Led.loop tick).
(define led-base    (lambda () #f))         ; current base-mode task
(define led-cur-pri -1)                      ; priority of the playing transient, -1 = none

;;!only if no transient is currently playing; otherwise it is restored afterward.

;; The LED queue (led-bq) is ticked by Led.loop (WS2812.scm) in the main loop.

;;; ---- blink-pattern helper used by the signal vocabulary ----------------
;;!Blink `zone` in `rgb` against black.  n>0 = N blinks then done (one task via
;;!seq); n=0 = blink forever (a cycle).  on-ms / off-ms are the phase durations.

;;; ---- battery / peripheral-rail check --------------------------------------
;;!The ESP32 is USB-powered, but the WS2812 ring, sonar, and servos all draw the
;;!battery 5 V rail.  So a lit ring proves the rail is up; a dark ring with a
;;!healthy ADC reading isolates a switch/rail fault from a flat pack; a low ADC
;;!means the cells themselves are depleted.  `(battery-check)` reads the battery
;;!ADC (pin-ADC) and paints the ring as a fuel gauge -- green (good) / yellow
;;!(marginal) / red (low); the number of lit LEDs is remaining charge, a fully
;;!dark ring means no rail power.  Logs the raw count + an estimated voltage.
;;!The two thresholds and the volts scale are CALIBRATE placeholders: set them
;;!against a multimeter on a known-good pack and at the safe cutoff.
