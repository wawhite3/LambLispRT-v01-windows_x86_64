;;; B200: these three used to fingerprint the dialect by WHAT `(if #f #t)` RETURNS.  Never do that.
;;; R7RS makes a one-armed `if` with a false test UNSPECIFIED, so the probe read a value every
;;; implementation is free to change -- and B192 changed LambLisp's from `#f` to a proper
;;; unspecified object, because `#f` is Scheme's only FALSE value and an unspecified result must
;;; not act as a NO.  The fingerprint then inverted: `LambLisp?` went #f, and `ChezScheme?` went #t
;;; (both `(if #f #t)` and `(printf "")` are now void, so the eqv? succeeded), so every startup on
;;; every target tried to `(load "Chez.scm")` -- a file that exists nowhere in the tree.
;;; This file cannot run under another Scheme in any case: line 3 calls `syslog` and the board
;;; tests below use `lamb-board`, both LambLisp-only, and both run BEFORE any adapter could load.
;;; So state the dialect positively instead of deducing it from a value nobody guarantees.
