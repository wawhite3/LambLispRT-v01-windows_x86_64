;;; *** UNTESTED END TO END AS OF 2026-09-22. ***  Written while the 4WD was inside a release
;;; sweep and could not be flashed.  Both halves it joins ARE proven separately:
;;;   * `llip-vision-send-frames` on the 4WD (Part D, in its manifest since 2026-09-17);
;;;   * `lvgl-frame-jpeg!` on this panel (this session -- a 1,411-byte JPEG decoded and rendered).
;;; The JOIN has never run.  Do not quote an fps figure from this file until it has.
;;;
;;; THIS FILE IS SMALL BECAUSE THE WIRE ALREADY EXISTED AND I ALMOST MISSED IT.
;;; My first draft of Part G step 3 was a SENDER that pushed each frame as an `#u8(...)` literal
;;; inside an `(eval ...)` -- ~3.4x expansion, and a reimplementation of something already in the
;;; 4WD's manifest.  `features/llip-vision.scm` has carried a binary frame codec since Part D:
;;; one s-expression header line, then exactly LEN raw bytes, unencoded, because every LambLisp
;;; port is already a binary port.  Measured there: a 240x240 frame is 4,954 bytes; base64 would
;;; have spent 6,605.  So the sender exists, the codec exists, and the ONLY missing piece was a
;;; SINK on this end.  `llip-vision-serve` already accepts and loops -- it writes each frame to a
;;; FILE, because Part D's consumer is a VLM on the Jetson and every vision model takes a path.
;;; A HUD's consumer is the glass, so this is that same loop with the file replaced.
;;;
;;; THE FRAME IS NOT WRITTEN TO FLASH, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE.  At 10 fps a
;;; write-then-read would be 10 flash writes a second on a part rated for ~100k erase cycles, to
;;; move bytes we are already holding in RAM.

;;; RGB bus costs a further 10-13 dB on a weak signal.  So the link is the most likely thing to
;;; degrade, and the frame rate is what degrades FIRST -- silently, because a slow camera feed and
;;; a stationary scene look identical.  RSSI on screen is what lets an operator tell "nothing is
;;; moving" from "nothing is arriving", which is [P123] E15 applied to the wire.
;;;
;;; RSSI IS SIGNED AND SMALL: -68 is good, -75 is fair, -85 is trouble.  Shown raw rather than as
;;; bars because a number can be read out loud to whoever is holding the other end of the problem.

;;; ===========================================================================================
;;; NON-BLOCKING RECEIVER [B628] -- the shape every other loop-sharing service in this tree uses.
;;; ===========================================================================================
;;;
;;; `hud-panel-serve` below owns the main loop for its whole window and, worse, could never give
;;; it back: measured 2026-09-25, the panel stopped answering its REPL permanently while still
;;; replying to pings, and only a reset recovered it.  ICMP is answered by lwIP inside the network
;;; stack, independent of the Scheme loop, so a wedged panel looks healthy to every network check
;;; anyone reaches for first.  REPL silence WITH successful pings is the signature.
;;;
;;; AND THE WEDGE PROPAGATES BACKWARDS.  A receiver that stops reading makes the SENDER's write
;;; block once the TCP window fills, so the vehicle's main loop wedged too -- taking its sonar,
;;; its reflexes and its LLIP control channel with it.  One stalled display disabled the robot.
;;;
;;; THE RULE THIS BREAKS: anything sharing the main loop must be a POLL that returns every tick --
;;; `llip-server-poll` is documented exactly that way.  A service that "runs until done" cannot
;;; live on a cooperative loop, because "done" is decided by a peer you do not control.
;;;
;;; TWO BOUNDS, BOTH NECESSARY:
;;;   * `char-ready?` before any read, so a tick with no data costs nothing and never blocks;
;;;   * a DEADLINE inside the record read, because `char-ready?` promises ONE character and a
;;;     record needs a whole line (or LEN bytes).  A peer that sends half a header and dies would
;;;     otherwise block forever on a port that was "ready".
;;; On timeout the connection is CLOSED rather than retried: a peer that cannot finish a record
;;; is not going to, and holding it costs a tick every time round.

;;; A CONNECTION THAT NEVER SPEAKS MUST BE DROPPED, OR IT BLOCKS EVERY LATER SENDER.
;;; Measured 2026-09-25 and it is not a corner case: a sender that wedges or is killed leaves its
;;; socket in this board's ACCEPT BACKLOG.  The poll accepts that corpse, holds it, and -- since it
;;; never sends -- `char-ready?` is correctly #f forever, so the close path never runs and no real
;;; sender is ever accepted.  The next vehicle to connect then fills its TCP window with nobody
;;; reading and WEDGES ITSELF.  One dead socket on the display disabled the robot, repeatedly.
;;; The symptom gives no hint: the panel reports "listening", holds a connection, and shows zero
;;; frames, which reads as a vehicle that is not sending.
(define hud-panel-idle-ms 8000)         ;;;!< silence after which a SPOKEN-TO connection is dropped

;;; A CONNECTION THAT HAS NEVER SAID ANYTHING GETS A MUCH SHORTER ROPE THAN ONE THAT HAS.
;;; The two cases are not alike and sharing one timeout was costing real sends.  A live sender
;;; writes as soon as it connects -- the vehicle's codec does exactly that -- so silence right
;;; after accept means the socket is almost certainly finished, while silence from a peer that
;;; has already delivered records is an ordinary gap between frames.  Measured 2026-09-26: a send
;;; that arrives while the slot is still occupied by a previous connection is LOST, not delayed
;;; (checked at +2/+6/+14 s -- the value never appears), so the width of that window is the width
;;; of the hole.  Eight seconds is wider than a whole send cycle; two is not.
;;; THIS NARROWS THE HOLE, IT DOES NOT CLOSE IT -- see the registry entry.  Closing it needs the
;;; port layer to say "peer closed", which `char-ready?` does not report for these sockets.

;;; for both "the peer hung up" and "the deadline passed mid-line", and the caller closed the
