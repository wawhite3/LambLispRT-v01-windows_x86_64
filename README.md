# LambLispRT-v01 -- Windows x86-64

A native Windows build of the **LambLisp** real-time Scheme runtime.

## Contents

| | |
|---|---|
| `LambLisp.exe` | the interpreter (PE32+ console, x86-64) |
| `data\`        | `setup.scm` and the standard library it loads at boot |
| `scm\`         | the complete Scheme library source |

## Run it

Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell **in this folder** and run:

```
LambLisp.exe
```

The working directory matters: `LambLisp.exe` loads `data\setup.scm` by relative path, so starting
it from elsewhere reports `cannot open input file: setup.scm`.  See the manual chapter
*Quick Start: Try LambLisp on Windows* for how to launch it from anywhere.

## What this build does NOT include

This is a LANGUAGE build, not a performance or fieldbus one.  Sockets, raw terminal mode and the
native code generator are compiled out -- the same subset the WebAssembly builds use.  **Do not
quote performance figures from it:** LambLisp's performance claims are claims about running on a
microcontroller, and a Windows laptop is a host.

#### Start here

**[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** -- what is in this package, how to run the binary, and how to
build and flash it.  It is a short read and it is the fastest way from this download to a `LL=>`
prompt.

- [LambLisp PDF manual at github](https://wawhite3.github.io/LambLispRT-v01-linux_x86_64/LambLisp.pdf)
- [Full LambLisp repositories on github](https://github.com/wawhite3/?tab=repositories&q=LambLispRT&type=&language=&sort=)

#### Try it without installing anything

Run the published container image.  It boots straight to the `LL=>` prompt, installs nothing on
your machine, and is multi-architecture -- `docker pull` selects amd64 or arm64 for you:

    docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/lamblisp/lamblisp:runtime

Or open `demo/index.html` from this package to run *LambLisp* in your browser, with no download
and no toolchain.

#### The other ways to get LambLisp

| | |
|---|---|
| **Linux** | this package, and the other `LambLispRT-v01-linux_*` repositories.  Requires glibc 2.34 or later (Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, RHEL 9 or newer) |
| **Windows** | a native `LambLisp.exe`, at [LambLispRT-v01-windows_x86_64](https://github.com/wawhite3/LambLispRT-v01-windows_x86_64) |
| **Container** | `ghcr.io/lamblisp/lamblisp:runtime` -- no host glibc or CPU requirement at all |
| **ESP32 and other boards** | the per-board `LambLispRT-v01-esp32*` repositories |

Building and flashing ESP32 firmware needs the Linux package and a local PlatformIO install; the
container carries the runtime only.

Shipped with this package:

- `QUICKSTART.md` - run it, build it, flash it: start here
- `BUILD-INFO` - exactly which commit, toolchain and feature set produced these binaries
- `LambLisp_ProductBrief.pdf` - product brief: specifications, embedded benchmarks and GC-pause figures
- `LambLisp_Announcement.pdf` - product announcement
- `LambLisp.pdf` / `html/` - the full reference manual
- `demo/` - the in-browser demo; open `demo/index.html`

**LambLisp** is designed for intelligent automated control of physical processes.

*LambLisp* is a real-time implementation of the *Lisp* programming language, designed for compatibility with the *Scheme R5RS* and *R7RS* specifications,
with a large set of features to support real-time control and reuse of existing C/C++ device drivers.

LambLisp includes **Arduino**-style I/O and supports direct digital/analog pin access, I2C, WiFi, Bluetooth, and more.
The embedded control version of LambLisp is currently running on several variants of Espressif ESP32.
The LambLisp application for the Freenove 4WD autonomous vehicle provides examples of device driver interaction and other real-time capabilities.

LambLisp also runs on 64-bit Linux, both x86_64 and aarch64.
Although Linux does not offer real-time guarantees, the Linux versions of LambLisp have bindings available for Nvidia CUDA.
LambLisp can be linked with CUDA kernels and perform a supervisory role marshalling data to the AI coprocessor,
launching CUDA kernels, and reasoning about the results.

The combination of embedded LambLisp and LambLisp+CUDA offers tremendous potential.

Thank you for your interest in **LambLisp**.
