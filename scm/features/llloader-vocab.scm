;;; llloader-vocab.scm -- the LLIP frame vocabulary for the OTA LOADER.  [P253] phase 1.
;;;
;;; A SIBLING OF llip-frame.scm, NOT PART OF IT (owner, 2026-09-30).  The robot-control vocabulary
;;; and a bootloader's have no reason to version together, and coupling them means a move-program
;;; change can invalidate a generated C header INSIDE THE TRUSTED ROOT.  Two files, one generator.
;;;
;;; PURE DATA, like llip-frame.scm: no OTA calls here, so it loads and validates on any LambLisp
;;; including the host.  The executor is the loader's C, which this file never touches.
;;;
;;; THE LOADER PARSES A DELIBERATELY SMALLER GRAMMAR THAN LLIP AS A WHOLE.  It needs the frames
;;; addressed to it, not the language -- and the limits below are the security argument made
;;; STRUCTURAL rather than promised: no general strings (the only string form is exactly 64 hex, a
;;; sha256, so a literal cannot carry a payload), a fixed depth of 2 (no stack, no recursion), and a
;;; bounded frame (nothing to exhaust).  See [P253] for why the surface is smaller than the HTTP
;;; client the loader already runs.
;;;
;;; NO MANIFEST NAMES THIS FILE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE -- NOT AN OMISSION.  Its consumer is the
;;; LOADER's C, via the generated `w3_loader/src/llloader_llip_vocab.h`; the loader is a separate
;;; ESP-IDF project with no LambLisp and no filesystem image, so there is nothing for a `data/`
;;; entry to serve.  `llip-frame.scm` rides `Freenove-4WD-Car-Kit-ESP32.manifest` because a
;;; LambLisp on that board reads it at runtime.  If a LambLisp node ever needs to SPEAK these
;;; frames rather than have them compiled in, add it to that node's manifest then -- and say
;;; which node, because "shipped to every target" is how a vocabulary acquires consumers nobody
;;; can enumerate.
;;;
;;; GENERATED CONSUMER: `python3 w3_ai_scripts/llip_vocab_gen.py --write` (`--check` in
;;; `verify_truth.sh` section 29 keeps it honest).  Editing the header instead of this file is
;;; the mistake the DO-NOT-EDIT banner exists to stop; the generator's `--check` is what makes
;;; the banner more than a request.

;;; --- the loader's own actions.  THESE ARE `loader_action_t` IN w3_loader/src/llloader_main.c,
;;; IN ORDER, AND THE ORDER IS THE WIRE VALUE: normal=0 install=1 recover=2 console=3, which is
;;; what the VM writes into NVS `pending_update` via (ota-request-install!) and friends.
;;;
;;; [B716] `llip_vocab_gen.py --check` PARSES THAT ENUM AND REFUSES IF THIS LIST DISAGREES, because
;;; the first version of this list read `(install recover boot verify golden)` -- taken from prose
;;; in the loader's comments instead of from the enum.  `golden` is the want_golden FLAG, `boot` and
;;; `verify` are steps inside an install, `normal` was missing, and so was `console`: the loader's
;;; ONLY triggered mode and the fall-through for every failed path, i.e. the one value an
;;; (ota-state) reply most needs to be able to name.  The generator turned that misreading into a C
;;; enum inside the trusted root without complaint -- a generated consumer that matches a wrong
;;; source is as wrong as a hand-copied one, and more convincing.
;;;
;;; TWO CHECKS, BECAUSE NEITHER SEES THE OTHER'S HALF: the generator compares the NAMES and their
;;; order; the host suite (w3_loader/test) asserts the NUMBERS (normal==0 ... console==3).  A
;;; reorder made consistently in BOTH files passes the name check and silently renumbers the wire
;;; protocol, so a request for RECOVER would arrive as INSTALL -- measured, and the suite catches
;;; exactly that.  Add an action here and in the enum, and the checks will tell you if you did one.
(define llloader-actions  '(normal install recover console))

;;; --- the OTA source ladder.  THESE ARE THE `image_source_t.name` STRINGS THE RUNGS ASSIGN,
;;; in ladder order, NOT the words source_ladder.c's header comment uses.  `llip_vocab_gen.py
;;; --check` greps w3_loader/src/ for each one and refuses if any is unspelled.
;;;
;;; [B719] The first version read `(aux-fs http ble console)` -- taken from that header comment
;;; ("1. aux-storage / 2. network / 3. BLE / UART") instead of from the assignments, so three of
;;; the four were wrong.  Caught at the moment of FIRST USE, emitting `(rung ...)` in a reply:
;;; the name would have gone on the wire absent from the generated `llloader_rung_t`, and the
;;; reader could not have caught it -- it validates that a value IS a symbol, not that the symbol
;;; is a member of this list.
;;;
;;; AND IT WAS [B716] A SECOND TIME.  That entry was this same defect in `llloader-actions`, fixed
;;; four hours earlier by checking ACTIONS and stopping there -- the site, not the class.  Three
;;; lists in this file describe code; `llloader-slots` was audited at the same time and is correct.

(define llloader-slots    '(ota_0 ota_1))

;;; --- the loader<->VM NVS contract, namespace "ota-p125".  [P255] phase 0.
;;;
;;; ONE HOME FOR THE KEY NAMES AND THEIR TYPES.  Both ends of a reboot boundary read these: the VM
;;; writes them (src/ll_xmop3_OTA.cpp) and the factory loader reads them (w3_loader/src).  A key
;;; name misspelt on one side is not an error anywhere -- `nvs_get_*` simply returns NOT_FOUND and
;;; the reader takes its default, so the handshake silently degrades to "nothing pending".  Hence
;;; the names live here and are generated into a header for each side.
;;;
;;; `death_reason` IS A SYMBOL, NOT FREE TEXT, and its bound is llloader-max-symbol: the loader
;;; relays it inside an `ota-death` frame, and that frame has to satisfy the same grammar as every
;;; other.  The application chooses its own failure vocabulary -- the loader never interprets a
;;; reason, only carries it -- so a new reason needs no change in the trusted root.

;;; emits on its own -- progress during an install, a result, a death record at boot -- has no
;;; request to echo and carries 0.  Decided when the reply-only path was built, because the
;;; alternative (a per-boot counter) makes an unsolicited frame indistinguishable from an answer to
;;; someone's question, and a reader acting on the wrong one is a worse failure than losing the
;;; ability to order progress frames -- which `bytes`/`of` already give.
;;;
;;; `query` frames are READ-ONLY and answerable before authentication if the owner allows it
;;; ([P253] open question 2); `command` frames set the pending action the loader already reads
;;; from NVS, and require an authenticated session.
